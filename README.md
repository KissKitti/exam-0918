# Open chat

List all the previously sent messages.
New messages should be queried every 20 seconds.
The user should be able to send messages.
Successfully sent messages should instantly appear on the screen, without querying all the previously sent messages.
Unsuccessfully sent messages should not be added to the screen, and an error should be shown to the user without clearing the input fields. (Sometimes the server is overloaded with requests!)
Upon successful message sending, the message input should be cleared.

Hint: You can simulate messages from other users using Insomnia.
